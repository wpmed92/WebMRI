<P>BET (Brain Extraction Tool) deletes non-brain tissue from an
image of the whole head. It can also estimate the external skull
surface.

<p>BET2 is a new version of the original bet C program, with the
additional functionality of also being able to estimate inner and
outer skull surfaces, and outer scalp surface, if you have good
quality T1 <i>and</i> T2 input images. BET2 comprises two main
programs:

<UL>
<LI><b>bet2</b> - a direct recoding of bet into c++, with close to identical results
<LI><b>betsurf</b> - using a registered T1 and T2 image pair, estimates
inner and outer skull surfaces and outer scalp surface
</UL>

<p>Note that BET v2.0 should be considered a "beta release" as it has
not yet been very widely tested. There is not yet a GUI for bet2.

<P>For more detail on BET and a journal reference, see the <A
HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/bet/">BET research
web page</A>. If you use BET in your research, please quote the
journal reference listed there.


<A NAME="bet2"></A><hr><H2>bet2</H2>

<p><b>bet2</b> has virtually the same functionality as the original <a
href="../bet/index.html">bet</a> command-line program. You can use the
same command-line syntax as before, with the main addition being the
<b>-e</b> option for outputting a "mesh" version of the estimated
brain mask.

<A NAME="betsurf"></A><hr><H2>betsurf</H2>

<p><b>betsurf</b> is the program that produces the three additional
surfaces (inner & outer skull, outer scalp). It can output these
surfaces as filled-in binary mask images, surface-only binary mask
images and <a href="http://www.geomview.org">Geomview</a> OFF mesh
format files.

<p>betsurf requires ideally good resolution T1- and T2-weighted input
images. It can work only from just a T1 image, but the results will
generally not be as good. The images should ideally be better than
2x2x2mm - the smaller the voxel size the better. betsurf requires that
bet2 has already been run on the T1 image, with the -e mesh output
option for the brain surface. It also requires that the T2 image
already be aligned (e.g., using <a
href="../flirt/index.html">flirt</a>) to the T1. Finally, it requires
that you supply a transformation from the T1 to standard space (e.g.,
generated by flirt) as it uses standard-space masks in order to
constraint some of the mesh fitting.

<p>The .off Geomview mesh output files contain vertex co-ordinates in
real-world space with the co-ordinate axis in the corner of the image
- i.e., the values are the integer voxel co-ordinates multiplied by
the voxel size values (and any co-ordinate centre set in the header is
not used).

<p>As an example of how to use bet2 and betsurf together, see the
<b>betall</b> script (in $FSLDIR/bin). This:<UL>

<LI>Registers the T2 to the T1 image.

<LI>Registers the T1 image to standard space (not to transform the
image but just to get the transform matrix itself).

<LI>Runs bet2 to get the initial brain extraction from the T1 image.

<LI>Runs betsurf to get the other head surfaces.
