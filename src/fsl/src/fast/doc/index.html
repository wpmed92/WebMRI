<HR><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
 
<P>FAST (FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool) segments a 3D image of
the brain into different tissue types (Grey Matter, White Matter, CSF,
etc.), whilst also correcting for spatial intensity variations (also
known as bias field or RF inhomogeneities). The underlying method is
based on a hidden Markov random field model and an associated
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The whole process is fully
automated and can also produce a bias field-corrected input image and
a probabilistic and/or partial volume tissue segmentation. It is
robust and reliable, compared to most finite mixture model-based
methods, which are sensitive to noise. It is also very
fast. Currently, it takes less than ten minutes to segment a
256x256x50 volume on a 500MHz Pentinum III PC.

<P>For more detail on FAST and an updated journal reference, see the <A
HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/fast/">FAST research
web page</A>. If you use FAST in your research, please quote the
journal reference listed there.

<A NAME="Fast"></A><hr><H2>PREPROCESSING</H2>

<p>Before running FAST an image of a head should first be
brain-extracted, using <a href="../bet/index.html">BET</a>. The
resulting brain-only image can then be fed into FAST.

<H3>MAIN OPTIONS</H3>
 
<P>If there is only one input image (ie you are not carrying out
multi-channel segmentation) then leave the <b>Number of input
channels</b> at 1. Otherwise, set appropriately.

<p>Now select the <b>Input image(s)</b>.

<p>Now set the <b>Image type</b>. This aids the segmentation in
identifying which classes are which tissue type. Note that this option
is not used for multi-channel segmentation.

<p>Now select the <b>Output image(s) basename</b>. Output images will
have filenames derived from this basename. For example, the main
ouput, the <b>Binary segmentation: All classes in one image</b> will
have filename &lt;basename&gt;_seg.hdr . If multi-channel
segmentation is carried out, some of the optional outputs will have
basenames derived instead from the input names (but into the directory
of the outputbasename). For example, the main segmentation output will
be as described above, but the restored images (one for each input
image) will be named according to the input images.

<p>Now choose the <b>Number of classes</b> to be segmented. Normally
you will want 3 (Grey Matter, White Matter and CSF). However, if there
is very poor grey/white contrast you may want to reduce this to 2;
alternatively, if there are strong lesions showing up as a fourth
class, you may want to increase this. Also, if you are segmenting
T2-weighted images, you may need to select 4 classes so that dark
non-brain matter is processed correctly (this is not a problem with
T1-weighted as CSF and dark non-brain matter look similar).

<p>The various output images are:
<UL>

<LI><b>Binary segmentation: All classes in one image</b>: This output
is a "hard" segmentation, where each voxel is classified into only one
class. A single image contains all the necessary information, with the
first class taking intensity value 1 in the image, etc.

<LI><b>Binary segmentation: One image per class</b>: This is also a
hard segmentation output; the difference is that there is one output
image per class, and values are only either 0 or 1.

<LI><b>Probability maps</b>: This produces a (non-hard) posterior
probability image for each class, with each voxel in the range 0-1.

<LI><b>Partial volume maps</b>: This produces a (non-hard) partial
volume image for each class, with each voxel in the range 0-1.

<LI><b>Restored input</b>: This is the estimated restored input image
after correction for bias field.

<LI><b>Bias field</b>: This is the estimated bias field.

</UL>

<H3>ADVANCED OPTIONS</H3>
 
<P><b>Use a-priori probability maps</b> tells FAST to start by
registering the input image to standard space and then use standard
tissue-type probability maps (from the MNI152 dataset) instead of the
initial K-means segmentation, in order to estimate the initial
parameters of the classes. This can help in cases where there is very
bad bias field. By default the a-priori probability maps are only used
to initialise the segmentation; however, you can also optionally tell
FAST to use these priors in the final segmentation - this can help,
for example, with the segmentation of deep grey structures.

<p><b>Use file of initial tissue-type means</b> tells FAST to use a
text file with mean intensity values (separated by newlines) for the
starting mean values of the different classes to be segmented. This is
then used instead of the automated K-means starting parameter
estimation.

<p><b>Do 2D (slice-by-slice) segmentation instead of 3D</b> tells FAST
to work in 2D and not 3D. This can help when there is very strong bias
field variation in Z.
