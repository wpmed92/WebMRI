<H2>FEAT User Preferences</H2>

<p>You can setup a large number of FEAT parameters in a preferences
file, which the FEAT GUI will read each time you start it. For
example, you can set pre-stats processing options or post-stats
thresholding options such that FEAT will always use your preferences
by default.

<p>All you have to do is:
<pre>
mkdir -p ~/.fslconf
cp $FSLDIR/etc/fslconf/feat.tcl ~/.fslconf
</pre>
then edit <code>~/.fslconf/feat.tcl</code> to change any parameters you wish. Next time you
start the FEAT GUI it will use these settings.

<p>All the lines starting with "#" are comments and get ignored by
FEAT. For yes/no settings, 0=no and 1=yes - other settings are
explained in the comment lines. For further information on the options
see the relevant bubble-help in the GUI or look at the <a
href="detail.html">detailed FEAT page</a>.

<p>You can also set these defaults for all users by changing
parameters in the central startup file $FSLDIR/etc/fslconf/feat.tcl
