<H2>Before Running FEAT</H2>

<p>Before calling the FEAT GUI, you need to prepare each session's
data as a 4D NIFTI or Analyze format image; there are utilities in
fsl/bin called <a href="../avwutils/index.html" target="_top">avwmerge
and avwsplit</a> to convert between multiple 3D images and a single 4D
(3D+time) image. If the data requires any scanner-specific corrections
(for example, for artefacts such as slice dropouts), this should be
applied to the data before running FEAT.

<p>Structural images for use as "highres" images in registration
should normally be brain-extracted using <a href="../bet/index.html"
target="_top">BET</a> before being used by FEAT.
