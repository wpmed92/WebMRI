<p>Featwatcher is a simple GUI that presents the progress of a FEAT
analysis. When you start FEAT running with the <b>Go</b> button, it
automatically brings up the Featwatcher GUI. At the top is the name of
the FEAT output directory; under that is a small panel which shows
some running statistics on the currently running FEAT sub-process -
%CPU usage, total CPU time so far and memory usage. In the large panel
is shown the <b>report.log</b> file which lists all commands run by
FEAT, along with their output.

<p>You can also run <b>Featwatcher
&lt;feat_directory_name.feat&gt;</b> from the command line, to view
the progress in an existing running FEAT directory.

<p>Note that FEAT still keeps running if you exit Featwatcher or the
FEAT GUI, and even, in general, if you completely log out of your
computer.
