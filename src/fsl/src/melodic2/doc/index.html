<HR><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
 
<P>MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition
into Independent Components) uses ICA (Independent Component Analysis)
to decompose 4D data (for example FMRI data) into different
interesting spatial and temporal components. It can pick out different
activation and artefactual components without any model being
specified. Thus the output is a new 4D data set (each volume being a
separate spatial component) and a text file of separate time courses
(temporal components).

<P>For more detail on MELODIC and an updated journal reference, see
the <A
HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/melodic/">MELODIC
research web page</A>. If you use MELODIC in your research, please
quote the journal reference listed there.

<p>The different MELODIC programs are:

<LI><a href="#Melodic">Melodic</a> - MELODIC GUI<br>

<p>Press <code>Select 4D data</code> and select the input data.

<p>Low-frequency drifts and motion in the data can adversely affect
the decomposition. In most cases, you would want to motion-correct the
data and remove these drifts first. This can be done from within the
Melodic GUI <code>Pre-stats</code> section.

The MELODIC section finally lets you control some of the options for
          the decomposition.
The default setting will most probably already be set to what you
          would want most of the time.

<p> By default, Melodic will automatically estimate the number of
          components from the data - you can switch this
          option off and then can specify the number of
          components explicitly.<p>
Melodic will also by default carry out inference on the estimated maps
          using the mixture model approach. A threshold level of 0.5
          in the case of alternative hypothesis testing means that a
          voxel 'survives' thresholding as soon as the probability
          of being in the 'active' class (as modelled by the Gamma
          densities) exceeds the probability of being in the
          'background' noise class. This threshold level assumes that
          you are placing an equal loss on false-positives and
          false-negatives. If, however, you consider e.g. false-positives as
          being twice as bad as false-negatives you should change this value
          to 0.66...<p>
Now simply press &nbsp;<code>Go</code><p>

Melodic will then generate the results and 
your terminal window will tell you where to find the web report. 



Each webpage shows one spatial map thresholded and rendered on top of an example functional scan
followed by the relevant time-course of the ICA decomposition and the
            power-spectrum of the time-course. If you click on the
            thresholded map, you can inspect the raw IC output
            together with probability maps and the Mixture Model
            fit. Use <code>previous</code> and <code>next</code> to
            view another component map.<p>
