<HR><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
 
<P>FLIRT (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool) is a fully automated
robust and accurate tool for linear (affine) intra- and inter-modal
brain image registration.

<P>
<P>For more detail on FLIRT and an updated journal reference, see the <A
HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/flirt/">FLIRT research
web page</A>. If you use FLIRT in your research, please quote the
journal reference listed there.

<p>The different FLIRT programs are:

<LI><a href="gui.html">Flirt</a> - FLIRT GUI + InvertXFM, ApplyXFM, ConcatXFM<br>
<LI><a href="overview.html">flirt</a> - command-line FLIRT program<br>
<LI><a href="overview.html#misc">misc flirt utilities</a> - associated command-line programs<br>
</UL>

If you want to register FMRI data with only a few slices, then see <a

<A NAME="section4"></A><HR><H2>GENERAL ADVICE</H2>
 
<UL>

<LI>Use the image with the best quality (tissue contrast and resolution)
as the Reference image, otherwise poor registrations may occur (the inverse
transformation can be found afterwards using the <b>InvertXFM</b> gui or the <b>convert_xfm</b> command-line utility).
<LI>Do use the default settings (especially in the GUI advanced
options) as they have been carefully chosen.  
<LI>Do use it for registering to the MNI standard brains as it has been
extensively tested with these images.
<LI>For images showing pathology, consider using binary cost function weighting
images - a zero for areas of a pathological nature and one elsewhere (do not put zero outside the brain).
<LI>Consider using the Group facility (GUI only)
for running the registration on a collection of images (this is also easily
achieved with the command-line version by scripting).
