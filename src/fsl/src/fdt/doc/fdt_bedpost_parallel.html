<p><h3>Parallelising bedpost</h3> Bedpost runs Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling to build up distributions on diffusion parameters at
each voxel. This is a very slow process, so bedpost is very processor
hungry (a typical bedpost run might take around 20hrs for 60
direction 2.5mm isotropic data!). However, fortunately bedpost
processes every voxel independently, so it is very easy to
parallelise.  

<br><br> In order to parallelise bedpost you need
multiple processors which can see the same data directory, and which
you can log onto using a remote call which does not require a
password.
<br><br>
When you have this, you need to set the following environment variables:
<br><br>
<table><TR> <TD> <code>FSLMACHINELIST</code>:</TD><TD> a list of
machines on which bedpost should be run. Each machine can be included
more than once to make use of multiple processor machines.</TD></TR>
<TD> <code>FSLREMOTECALL</code>:</TD><TD>The program you want to use
to make the remote calls, e.g. ssh or rsh</TD></table>
<br>
e.g. for a <code>bash </code> user:<br>
<code>FSLMACHINELIST="machine1 machine1 machine2 machine3 machine5"</code><br>
<code> FSLREMOTECALL=ssh</code><br>
<code> export FSLMACHINELIST FSLREMOTECALL</code><br><br>

This will enable <code>bedpost</code> to use <code>ssh</code> to send jobs to two processors on <code>machine1</code>, and one each on <code>machine2 machine3 machine5</code>.<br><br>

You also need to make a file called <code>fsl.sh</code>, on each
machine listed, in one of the following places.<br>
<code>/usr/local/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh</code><br>
<code>/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh</code><br>
<code>${HOME}/.fslconf/fsl.sh</code><br><br>

in this file you need to set your <code>FSLDIR</code> in <code>sh</code> language. e.g.:<br>
<code>FSLDIR=/usr/local/fsl</code><br>
<code>export FSLDIR</code><br><br>
 
NB(1): you may already have this file, and it may set other config
variables (e.g. <code>FSLMACHINELIST</code> and <code>FSLREMOTECALL</code>). This is absolutely fine, as long as it also sets FSLDIR<br><br>
NB(2): If you are a <code>csh</code> or <code>tcsh</code> user you may
already have an equivalent <code>fsl.csh</code> in one of the above
directories. Note that you still need to specify the
<code>fsl.sh</code> file as above. Parallel bedpost uses
<code>sh</code> not <code>csh</code>.<br><br>
NB(3): If you have this file in more than one of
the above locations, bedpost will read them in the order specified
above, hence the the last setting of FSLDIR will be the one that
stands in the case of conflicts.

<p><h3>Locking bedpost</h3> You may want to set up a system whereby
only one person can use bedpost at any one time (thus keeping the
system load down). In order to do this, set the
<code>FSLLOCKDIR</code> environment variable to a directory which is
writeable by all users.  Every time a bedpost starts, it will write
<code>${FSLLOCKDIR}/.bedpost.lock</code> which will be removed when
bedpost completes. If this file is present, new bedpost processes will
not start.

<p><h3>Cleaning up bedpost</h3> Bedpost should be relatively well
behaved in most circumstances. e.g. If bedpost is cancelled from the
keyboard, then it first logs onto all machines in the list and kills
its child processes, leaving no trace. However, there are some
circumstances where bedpost might not behave so well - e.g. if the
master machine (from where bedpost is called) crashes, the processes
on the other machines will probably not be stopped. If this situation
occurs, there is a program called <code>bedpost_cleanup</code>, which
will kill all <code>bedpost</code> related processes owned by the user
on all machines in <code>$FSLMACHINELIST</code>.
