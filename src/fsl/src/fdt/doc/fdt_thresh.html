<h3>proj_thresh</h3>
<b>proj_thresh</b> is a command line utility that provides an alternative way of
expressing connection probability in connectivity-based segmentation.  It is
run on the output of the <b>connectivity-based seed
classification</b> mode within <a href="fdt_probtrack.html"> <b>ProbTrack</b></a>.
<p>The output of <b>Connectivity-based seed classification</b> is a single volume for
each target mask, named <b>seeds_to_{target}</b> where {target} is replaced
by the file name of the relevant target mask. In these output images, the
value of each voxel within the seed mask is the number of samples seeded
from that voxel reaching the target mask. 
<br><b>proj_thresh</b> is run as follows:
<p><b>proj_thresh list_of_volumes threshold</b></p>
Where the list of volumes is the outputs of <b>Connectivity-based seed
classification</b> (i.e., files named seeds_to_target1 etc etc) and threshold is expressed as a number of samples
<br>For each voxel in the seeds mask that has a value above threshold for at
least one target mask, <b>proj_thresh</b> calculates the number of samples reaching each target mask
as a proportion of the total number of samples reaching any target mask.  The
output of <b>proj_thresh</b> is a single volume for each target mask.
