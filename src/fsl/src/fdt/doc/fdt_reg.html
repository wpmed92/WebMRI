<h3>Registration within FDT</h3>
<p>If tractography results are to be stored in any space other than diffusion
space then registration must be run.

<p>Registration within Fdt uses <a href="../flirt/index.html" target="_top">flirt</a>. Registration can only be
applied after Bedpost has been run.  Typically, registration will be run
between three spaces:
<ul><li>Diffusion space (using the nodif_brain image in the Bedpost directory)</li>
<li>Structural space (using the struct image in the Bedpost
directory, e.g., the space of a high resolution T1-weighted image of
the same subject)</li>
<li>Standard space (by default, the MNI152 brain stored within $FSLDIR/etc/standard)</li></ul>

<p>Note that struct must have had <a href="../bet/index.html" target="_top">bet</a> applied.  The nodif_brain image should be
the brain extracted version of the nodif image that is automatically stored in
the Bedpost directory.  The user will
have to manually apply bet to this image after running bedpost and before
running registration.  (it is important that the user check the quality of bet
results on these images and adjust the settings in bet where appropriate).

<p>Transformation matrices, and their inverses, will be derived from diffusion to structural space and
from structural to standard space.  Relevant matrices will be concatenated to
produce transformation matrices between diffusion and standard space.  The resulting matrices are stored within
the 'xfms' subdirectory of the bedpost directory and named as follows:  

<ul><li>diff2str.mat - from diffusion to structural space</li>
<li>str2diff.mat - from structural to diffusion space</li>
<li>diff2standard.mat - from diffusion to standard space</li>
<li>standard2diff.mat - from standard to diffusion space</li>
<li>str2standard.mat - from structural to standard space</li>
<li>standard2str.mat - from standard to structural space</li></ul>

<p>By default, transformation matrices between diffusion and structural space are
derived using 6 degrees of fredom, the mutual information cost
function and normal search; transformations matrices between structural and standard space
are derived using 12 degrees of freedom, the correlation ratio cost
function and normal search.  These parameters may be adjusted if required
using the drop down menus in the reigistration panel.
