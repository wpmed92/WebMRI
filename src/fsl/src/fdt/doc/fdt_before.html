<h3>Before running</h3>

<p>Fdt requires 4D analyze data.  This will consist of a series of diffusion
weighted volumes and some volumes with no diffusion weighting applied. If you
are running Bedpost or dtifit you
will need text files describing the b-values applied during acquisition of
each volume ('bvals'), and the direction in which diffusion weighting was
applied ('bvecs').
