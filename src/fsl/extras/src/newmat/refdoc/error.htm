Most error messages are self-explanatory. The message gives the size of
the matrices involved.
Matrix types are referred to by the following codes:
<PRE>
   Matrix or vector                   Rect
   Symmetric matrix                   Sym
   Band matrix                        Band
   Symmetric band matrix              SmBnd
   Lower triangular matrix            LT
   Lower triangular band matrix       LwBnd
   Upper triangular matrix            UT
   Upper triangular band matrix       UpBnd
   Diagonal matrix                    Diag
   Crout matrix (LU matrix)           Crout
   Band LU matrix                     BndLU
</PRE>
Other codes should not occur.
<P>
See the section on
<A HREF="except.htm">exceptions</A> for more details on the structure of
the exception classes.
<P>
I have defined a class Tracer that is intended to help locate the place
where an error has occurred. At the beginning of a function I suggest
you include a statement like
<PRE>
   Tracer tr("name");
</PRE>
where name is the name of the function. This name will be printed as
part of the error message, if an exception occurs in that function, or
in a function called from that function. You can change the name as you
proceed through a function with the ReName function
<PRE>
   tr.ReName("new name");
</PRE>
if, for example, you want to track progress through the function.
