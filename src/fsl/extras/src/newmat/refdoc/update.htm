Newmat10 includes new <A HREF="scalar.htm">maxima, minima and Determinant</A> functions,
a faster <A HREF="fft.htm">FFT</A>,
revised <A HREF="make.htm">make</A> files for
GCC and CC compilers and several corrections,
new <A HREF="dimen.htm">ReSize</A> function.
The program files include a new file, <TT>newfft.cpp</TT>, so you will need to
include this in the list of files in your IDE and make files.
If you are updating from a
beta version of newmat09 look through the next section as there were some
late changes to newmat09.
<P>
If you are upgrading from newmat08 note the following:
<UL>
<LI>Boolean, TRUE, FALSE are now bool, true, false. See
<A HREF="custom.htm">customising</A> if your compiler supports the bool
class.

<LI>ReDimension is now <A HREF="dimen.htm">ReSize</A>.

<LI>The <A HREF="except.htm">simulated exception</A> package has been updated.

<LI>Operators <TT>==</TT>, <TT>!=</TT>, <TT>+=</TT>, <TT>-=</TT>, <TT>*=</TT>,
<TT>|=</TT>, <TT>&=</TT> are
now supported
as <A HREF="binary.htm">binary</A> matrix operators.

<LI><TT>A+=f</TT>, <TT>A-=f</TT>, <TT>A*=f</TT>, <TT>A/=f</TT>, <TT>f+A</TT>,
<TT>f-A</TT>, <TT>f*A</TT> are supported for 
<A HREF="matscal.htm">A matrix, f scalar</A>.

<LI><A HREF="trigtran.htm">Fast trigonometric transforms</A>.

<LI><A HREF="unary.htm">Reverse</A> function for reversing order
of elements in a vector or matrix.

<LI><A HREF="scalar.htm">IsSingular</A> function.

<LI>An option is included for defining <A HREF="namesp.htm">namespaces</A>.

<LI>Dummy inequality operators are defined for compatibiity with the STL.

<LI>The row/column classes in newmat3.cpp have been modified to improve
efficiency and correct an invalid use of pointer arithmetic. Most users
won't be using these classes explicitly; if you are, please contact me
for details of the changes.

<LI>Matrix LU decomposition rewritten (faster for large arrays).

<LI>The sort function rewritten (faster).

<LI>The documentation files newmata.txt and newmatb.txt have been amalgamated
and both are included in the hypertext version. 

<LI>Some of the <A HREF="make.htm">make</A> files reorganised again. 
</UL>
<P>
If you are upgrading from <B>newmat07</B> note the following:
<UL>
<LI>.cxx files are now .cpp files. Some versions of won't accept .cpp. The
<I>make</I>
files for Gnu and AT&amp;T link the .cpp files to .cxx files before
compilation and delete the links after compilation.

<LI>An <A HREF="custom.htm">option</A>
in include.h allows you to use
compiler supported exceptions,
simulated exceptions or disable exceptions.
Edit the file include.h to select one of these three options.
Don't simulate exceptions if you have set your compiler's
option to implement exceptions.

<LI>New <A HREF="qr.htm">QR decomposition</A>
functions.

<LI>A <A HREF="nonlin.htm">non-linear least squares</A> class.

<LI>No need to explicitly set the AT&amp;T option in include.h.

<LI><A HREF="binary.htm">Concatenation and elementwise multiplication</A>.

<LI>A new <A HREF="unspec.htm">GenericMatrix</A> class.

<LI><A HREF="scalar.htm">Sum</A> function.

<LI>Some of the <A HREF="make.htm">make</A> files reorganised. 
</UL>
<P>
If you are upgrading from <B>newmat06</B> note the following:
<UL>
<LI>If you are using &lt;&lt; to load a Real into a submatrix change this to =.
</UL>
<P>
If you are upgrading from <B>newmat03</B> or <B>newmat04</B>
note the following
<UL>
<LI>.hxx files are now .h files

<LI>real changed to Real

<LI>BOOL changed to Boolean

<LI>CopyToMatrix changed to AsMatrix, etc

<LI>real(A) changed to A.AsScalar()
</UL>
<P>
The current version is quite a bit longer that newmat04, so if you are
almost out of space with newmat04, don't throw newmat04 away until you
have checked your program will work under this version.
<P>
