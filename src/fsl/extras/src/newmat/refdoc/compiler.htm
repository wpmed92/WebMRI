I have tested this library on a number of compilers. Here are the levels
of success and any special considerations.
In most cases I have chosen code that
works under all the compilers I have access to, but I have had to
include some specific work-arounds for some compilers. For the PC
versions, I use a 486dx computer running windows 95, a Pentium computer
running windows NT or Linux (Red Hat 4.1) and a 386sx running MSDOS 5. The unix
versions are on a Sun Sparc station or a HP unix
workstation. Thanks to Victoria University and Industrial Research Ltd
for access to the Unix machines.
<P>
I have set up a block of code for each of the compilers in include.h.
Turbo, Borland, Gnu, Microsoft
and Watcom are recognised automatically. There is a default option that
works for AT&amp;T, Sun C++ 4.0.1 and HPUX. So you don't have to make any
changes for these compilers. Otherwise you may have to build your own set of
options in include.h.
