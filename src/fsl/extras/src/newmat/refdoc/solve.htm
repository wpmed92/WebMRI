To solve the matrix equation <TT>Ay = b</TT> where <TT>A</TT> is a
square matrix of equation coefficients, <TT>y</TT> is a column
vector of values to be solved for, and <TT>b</TT> is a column vector,
use the code
<PRE>
    int n = something
    Matrix A(n,n); ColumnVector b(n);
    ... put values in A and b
    ColumnVector y = A.i() * b;       // solves matrix equation
</PRE>
The following notes are for the case where you want to solve more than
one matrix equation with different values of <TT>b</TT> but the same
<TT>A</TT>. Or where
you want to solve a matrix equation and also find the determinant of
<TT>A</TT>.
In these cases you probably want to avoid repeating the LU decomposition of
<TT>A</TT>
for each solve or determinant calculation.
<P>


If <TT>A</TT> is a square or symmetric matrix use
<PRE>
    CroutMatrix X = A;                // carries out LU decomposition
    Matrix AP = X.i()*P; Matrix AQ = X.i()*Q;
    LogAndSign ld = X.LogDeterminant();
</PRE>
rather than
<PRE>
    Matrix AP = A.i()*P; Matrix AQ = A.i()*Q;
    LogAndSign ld = A.LogDeterminant();
</PRE>
since each operation will repeat the LU decomposition.
<P>
If <TT>A</TT> is a BandMatrix or a SymmetricBandMatrix
begin with
<PRE>
    BandLUMatrix X = A;               // carries out LU decomposition
</PRE>
A CroutMatrix or a BandLUMatrix can't be manipulated or
copied. Use
references as an alternative to copying.
<P>
Alternatively use
<PRE>
    LinearEquationSolver X = A;
</PRE>
This will choose the most appropriate decomposition of <TT>A</TT>. That is, the
band form if <TT>A</TT> is banded; the Crout decomposition if <TT>A</TT> is
square or symmetric and no decomposition if <TT>A</TT> is triangular or
diagonal. If you want to use the LinearEquationSolver <TT>#include
newmatap.h</TT>.
