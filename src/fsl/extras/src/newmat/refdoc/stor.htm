<H3><font color="#FF0000">Structure</H3></font>

<P>Each matrix object contains the basic information such as the number of
rows and columns and a status variable plus a pointer to the data
array which is on the heap.

<H3><font color="#FF0000">One block or several</H3></font>

<P>The elements of the matrix are stored as a
single array. Alternatives would have been to store each row as a
separate array or a set of adjacent rows as a separate array. The
present solution simplifies the program but limits the size of
matrices in 16 bit PCs that have a 64k byte limit on the
size of arrays (I don't use the <TT>huge</TT> keyword).
The large arrays may also cause problems for
memory management in smaller machines.

<H3><font color="#FF0000">By row or by column or other</H3></font>

<P>In Fortran two dimensional arrays are stored by column. In
most other systems they are stored by row. I have followed this
later convention. This makes it easier to interface with other
packages written in C but harder to interface with those written
in Fortran. This may have been a wrong decision. Most work on the
efficient manipulation of large matrices is being done in
Fortran. It would have been easier to use this work if I had
adopted the Fortran convention.

<P>An alternative would be to store the elements by mid-sized
rectangular blocks. This might impose less strain on memory
management when one needs to access both rows and columns.

<H3><font color="#FF0000">Storage of symmetric matrices</H3></font>

<P>Symmetric matrices are stored as lower triangular matrices.
The decision was pretty arbitrary, but it does slightly simplify
the Cholesky decomposition program.
