<P>
I describe some of the ideas behind this package, some of the
decisions that I needed to make and give some details about the
way it works. You don't need to read this part of the documentation
in order to use the package.
<P>
It isn't obvious what is the best way of going
about structuring a matrix package. I don't think you can
figure this out with <I>thought</I> experiments. Different
people have to try out different approaches. And someone else may
have to figure out which is best. Or, more likely, the ultimate packages
will lift some ideas from each of a variety of trial packages.
So, I don't claim my package is an <I>ultimate</I> package,
but simply a trial of a number of ideas. The following pages give some
background on these ideas.
