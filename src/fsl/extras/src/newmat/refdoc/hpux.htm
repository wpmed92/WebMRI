HP 9000 series HP-UX. I no longer have access to this compiler. Newmat09
worked without problems with the simulated exceptions; haven't tried the
built-in exceptions.
<P> With recent versions of the compiler you may get warning messages like
<TT>Unsafe cast between pointers/references to incomplete classes</TT>. At
present, I think these can be ignored.
<P>
Here are comments I made two years ago.
<P>
I have tried the library on two versions of HP-UX.
(I don't know the version numbers, the older is a clone of AT&T 3, the
newer is HP's version with exceptions).
Both worked after the modifications described in this section.
<P> 
With the older version of the compiler I needed to edit the math.h
library file to remove a duplicate definition of abs.
<P>
With the
newer version you can set the +eh option to enable exceptions and activate
the UseExceptions option in include.h. If you are using my make file,
you will need to replace CC with CC +eh where ever CC occurs. I recommend
that you do not do this and either disable exceptions or use my simulated
exceptions. I get core dumps when I use the built-in exceptions and suspect
they are not sufficiently debugged as yet.
<P>
If you are using my simulated exceptions you may get a mass of error messages
from the linker about __EH_JMPBUF_TEMP. In this case get file setjmp.h
(in directory /usr/include/CC ?) and put extern in front of the line
<PRE>
   jmp_buf * __EH_JMPBUF_TEMP;
</PRE>
The file setjmp.h is accessed in my file myexcept.h. You may want to change
the #include statement to access your edited copy of setjmp.h.
