I have included <I>make</I> files for a number of compilers. These provide an
alternative way of compiling your programs than with the IDE that comes with PC
compilers. See the <A HREF="files.htm">files section</A> for details.
See the <A HREF="example.htm">example</A> for how to use them. Leave out the
target name to compile and link all my examples and test files.

<H3><font color="#FF0000">PC</H3></font>

I include make files for some of PC compilers I have access to.
They all use the make utility that comes with the compiler. I don't know whether
they work with versions of the compilers other than the ones I have. The
make files
for Borland need editing to show where you have stored your Borland compiler.

<H3><font color="#FF0000">Unix</H3></font>

The <I>make</I> file for the Unix  CC compilers link a .cxx file to each .cpp
file since some of these compilers do not recognise .cpp as a legitimate
extension for a C++ file. I suggest you delete this part of the <I>make</I>
file and, if necessary, rename the .cpp files to something your compiler
recognises.
<P>
My <I>make</I> file for Gnu GCC on Unix systems are for use with <TT>gmake</TT>
rather than <TT>make</TT>. This defines BOOL_LIB so there is no need to do this
in <TT>include.h</TT>. I assume your compiler recognises the .cpp extension.
Ordinary <TT>make</TT> works with it on the Sun but not the Silicon
Graphics or HP machines. On Linux use <TT>make</TT>.
<P>
My make file for the CC compilers works with the ordinary make.
<P>
To compile everything with the CC compiler use
<PRE>
   make -f cc.mak
</PRE>
or for the gnu compiler use
<PRE>
   gmake -f gnu.mak
</PRE>
<P>
There is a line in
the make file for CC <TT>rm -f $*.cxx</TT>. Some systems won't accept this line and
you will need to delete it. In this case, if you have a bad compile and you
are using my scheme for linking .cxx files, you will
need to delete the .cxx file link generated by that compile before you can do
the next one.
