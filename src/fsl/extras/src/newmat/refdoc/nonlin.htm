Files solution.h, solution.cpp contain a class for solving for x in y =
f(x) where x is a one-dimensional continuous monotonic function. This is
not a matrix thing at all but is included because it is a useful thing
and because it is a simpler version of the technique used in the
non-linear least squares.
<P>
Files newmatnl.h, newmatnl.cpp contain a series of classes for
non-linear least squares and maximum likelihood.
<P>
Documentation for both of these is in the definition files. Simple
examples are in sl_ex.cpp, nl_ex.cpp and garch.cpp.
