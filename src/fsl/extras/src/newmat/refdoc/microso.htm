Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0: Seems to work OK. You can use the makefile
<TT>ms_nt.mak</TT>.
<P>
You must <TT>#define
TEMPS_DESTROYED_QUICKLY</TT> owing to a bug in version 7 (at least) of MSC.
There are some notes in the file <TT>include.h</TT> on changes to run under
version 7. I haven't tried newmat10 on version 7.
<P>
Microsoft Visual C++ 1.51. Disable exceptions, comment out the line in
include.h <TT>#define TEMPS_DESTROYED_QUICKLY_R</TT>. In <TT>tmt.cpp</TT>,
comment out the <TT>Try</TT> and <TT>CatchAll</TT> lines at the beginning
of <TT>main()</TT> and the line <TT>trymati()</TT>. You can use the makefile
<TT>ms.mak</TT>. You will probably need to break the
<A HREF="testing.htm">tmt</A> test files into two parts to get the program
to link.
<P>
If you can, upgrade to windows 95, 98 or window NT and use the 32 bit console
model.
<P>
If you are using the 16 bit large model, don't forget to keep all matrices
less than 64K bytes in length (90x90 for a rectangular matrix if you are
using <TT>double</TT> as your element type). Otherwise your program will
crash without warning or explanation.
You may need to break the <A HREF="testing.htm">tmt</A> set of test
files into two parts to get the program to fit into your computer. 
<P>
Microsoft Visual C++ 4: I haven't tried this - a correspondent reports:
I use Microsoft Visual C++ Version 4. there is only one minor problem.
In all files you must include
<TT>#include "stdafx.h"</TT> (presumably if you are using MFC).
This file contains essential information for VC++. Leave it out and
you get <I>Unexpected end of file</I>.
<P>
Microsoft Visual C++ 5: I have tried this in console mode and it seems to work
satisfactorily. There may be a problem with <A HREF="namesp.htm">namespace</A>
(fixed by Service Pack 3?).
<B>Turn optimisation off</B>. Edit <TT>include.h</TT> to use the
compiler supported exceptions. If you want to work under MFC
<TT>#include "stdafx.h"</TT> at the beginning of each .cpp file.
<P>
Microsoft Visual C++ 6: Get the latest service pack. I have tried this in
console mode and it seems to work
satisfactorily. Edit <TT>include.h</TT> to use the
compiler supported exceptions. If you want to work under MFC
<TT>#include "stdafx.h"</TT> at the beginning of each .cpp file.
