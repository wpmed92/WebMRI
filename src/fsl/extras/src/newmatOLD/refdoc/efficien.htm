The package tends to be not very efficient for dealing with matrices
with short rows. This is because some administration is required for
accessing rows for a variety of types of matrices. To reduce the
administration a special multiply routine is used for rectangular
matrices in place of the generic one. Where operations can be done
without reference to the individual rows (such as adding matrices of the
same type) appropriate routines are used.
<P>
When you are using small matrices (say smaller than 10 x 10) you may
find it faster to use rectangular matrices rather than the
triangular or symmetric ones.
