This package can be used with the vectors and matrices defined in
<I>Numerical Recipes in C</I>. You need to edit the routines in Numerical
Recipes so that the elements are of the same type as used in this
package. Eg replace float by double, vector by dvector and matrix by
dmatrix, etc. You may need to edit the function definitions to use
the version acceptable to your compiler (if you are using the first edition
of NRIC). You may need to enclose the code from
Numerical Recipes in <TT>extern "C" { ... }</TT>. You will also need to include
the matrix and vector utility routines.
<P>
Then any vector in Numerical Recipes with subscripts starting from 1 in
a function call can be accessed by a RowVector, ColumnVector or
DiagonalMatrix in the present package. Similarly any matrix with
subscripts starting from 1 can be accessed by an  nricMatrix  in the
present package. The class nricMatrix is derived from Matrix and can be
used in place of Matrix. In each case, if you wish to refer to a
RowVector, ColumnVector, DiagonalMatrix or nricMatrix X in an function
from Numerical Recipes, use <TT>X.nric()</TT> in the function call.
<P>
Numerical Recipes cannot change the dimensions of a matrix or vector. So
matrices or vectors must be correctly dimensioned before a Numerical
Recipes routine is called.
<P>
For example
<PRE>
   SymmetricMatrix B(44);
   .....                             // load values into B
   nricMatrix BX = B;                // copy values to an nricMatrix
   DiagonalMatrix D(44);             // Matrices for output
   nricMatrix V(44,44);              //    correctly dimensioned
   int nrot;
   jacobi(BX.nric(),44,D.nric(),V.nric(),&nrot);
                                     // jacobi from NRIC
   cout &lt;&lt; D;                        // print eigenvalues
</PRE>
