The library now does have a moderately graceful exit from
errors. One can use either the simulated exceptions or the
compiler supported exceptions. When newmat08 was released
(in 1995), compiler exception handling in the compilers I
had access to was
unreliable. I recommended you used my simulated exceptions.
Now (in 1997) compiler supported exceptions do seem to work
on a variety of compilers - but not all compilers.
<P>
The approach in the present library, attempting to simulate
C++ exceptions, is not completely satisfactory, but seems a good
interim solution for those who cannot use compiler supported
exceptions. People who don't want exceptions in any shape
or form, can set the option to exit the program if an exception
is thrown.
<P>
The exception mechanism cannot clean-up objects explicitly
created by new. This must be explicitly carried out by the
package writer or the package user. I have not yet done this
completely with
the present package so occasionally a little garbage may be left
behind after an exception. I don't think this is a big problem,
but it is one that needs fixing.
