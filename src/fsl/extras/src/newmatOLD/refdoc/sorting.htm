To sort the values in a matrix or vector, <TT>A</TT>, (in general this
operation
makes sense only for vectors and diagonal matrices) use
<PRE>
    SortAscending(A);
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
    SortDescending(A);
</PRE>
I use the quicksort algorithm. The algorithm is similar to that in
Sedgewick's algorithms in C++. If the sort seems to be failing (as quicksort
can do) an exception is thrown.
<P>
You will get incorrect results if you try to sort a band matrix - but why would
you want to sort a band matrix?
