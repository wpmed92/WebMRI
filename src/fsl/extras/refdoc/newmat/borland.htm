<B>Borland C++ 3.1, 4.5, 5.02</B>: Recently this has been my main development
platform, so naturally everything works with this compiler. There was a
problem with the library utility in version 2.0 which is now fixed. You
will need to use the large or 32 bit flat model. If you are not debugging,
turn off the
options that collect debugging information. Make sure you don't run
Borland's exceptions and my simulated exceptions at the same time.
<P>
If you are using version 5 remember to edit include.h to deactivate my Boolean
class.
<P>
When running my test program under ms-dos you may run out of
memory. Either compile the test routine to run under <I>easywin</I> or use
simulated exceptions rather than the built in exceptions. Under <I>easywin</I>
the test program indicates a memory leak. I presume this is partly because of
the way windows organises its heap rather than there being a real problem.
<P>
If you can, upgrade to windows 95 or window NT and use the 32 bit console
model.
<P>
If you are using the 16 bit large model, don't forget to keep all matrices
less than 64K bytes in length (90x90 for a rectangular matrix if you are
using <TT>double</TT> as your element type). Otherwise your program will
crash without warning or explanation.
You may need to break the <A HREF="testing.htm">tmt</A> set of test
files into two parts to get the program to fit into your computer. 
<P>
In version 4.5, under <I>easywin</I> the automatic
clean-up of objects by
the exception mechanism does not seem to work correctly.
Use my simulated exceptions if
this is a problem.
<P>
One version of Borland had DBL_MIN incorrectly defined. If you
are using an older version of Borland and are getting strange
numerical errors in the test programs reinstate the commented out
statements in precision.h.
<P>
I include make files that work under Borland 4.5 and 5. You will need
to edit these to correctly locate the directories for the include and
library files. Both assume you are using simulated exceptions. <TT>BC.MAK</TT>
also works with version 3.1 if you delete the options that are not recognised
and the reference to the library file that is not recognised.
<P>
<B>C++ Builder version 4</B>: I have successfully used this using the
console wizard (menu item file/new - select new tab).
Either use namespace or rename a couple of my exception names that conflict
with Borland. Use compiler exceptions. Suppose you are compiling my test
program tmt. Rename my <I>main()</I> function in <I>tmt.cpp</I> to
<I>my_main()</I>. Rename
<I>tmt.cpp</I> to <I>tmt_main.cpp</I>. Borland will generate a new
file <I>tmt.cpp</I> containing
their <I>main()</I> function. Put the line <TT>int my_main();</TT> above
this function
and put <TT>return my_main();</TT> into the body of <I>main()</I>.
