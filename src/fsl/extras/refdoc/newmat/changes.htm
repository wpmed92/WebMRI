<B>Newmat10 - August, 1999:</B>
<P>
Improve compatibility with GCC, fix errors in FFT and GenericMatrix, update simulated exceptions,
maxima and minima functions, Determinant function, update make files for CC and GCC, faster FFT, <TT>A.ReSize(B)</TT>.
<P>
<B>Newmat09 - September, 1997:</B>
<P>
Operator <TT>==</TT>, <TT>!=</TT>, <TT>+=</TT>, <TT>-=</TT>, <TT>*=</TT>,
<TT>/=</TT>, <TT>|=</TT>, <TT>&=</TT>. Follow new rules for
<I>for (int i; ... )</I> construct.
Change Boolean, TRUE, FALSE to bool, true, false. Change ReDimension
to ReSize. SubMatrix allows
zero rows and columns. Scalar <TT>+</TT>, <TT>-</TT> or <TT>*</TT>
matrix is OK. Simplify
simulated exceptions. Fix non-linear programs for AT&T
compilers. Dummy inequality operators. Improve internal row/column operations.
Improve matrix LU decomposition. Improve sort. Reverse function. IsSingular
function. Fast trig transforms. Namespace definitions.
<P>
<B>Newmat08A - July, 1995:</B>
<P>
Fix error in SVD.
<P>
<B>Newmat08 - January, 1995:</B>
<P>
Corrections to improve compatibility with Gnu, Watcom. Concatenation of
matrices. Elementwise products. Option to use compilers supporting exceptions.
Correction to exception module to allow global declarations of matrices. Fix
problem with inverse of symmetric matrices. Fix divide-by-zero problem in SVD.
Include new QR routines. Sum function. Non-linear optimisation.
GenericMatrices.
<P>
<B>Newmat07 - January, 1993</B>
<P>
Minor corrections to improve compatibility with Zortech, Microsoft and
Gnu. Correction to exception module. Additional FFT functions. Some
minor increases in efficiency. Submatrices can now be used on RHS of =.
Option for allowing C type subscripts. Method for loading short lists of
numbers.

<P>
<B>Newmat06 - December 1992:</B>
<P>
Added band matrices; 'real' changed to 'Real' (to avoid potential
conflict in complex class); Inject doesn't check for no loss of
information;  fixes for AT&amp;T C++ version 3.0; real(A) becomes
A.AsScalar(); CopyToMatrix becomes AsMatrix, etc; .c() is no longer
required (to be deleted in next version); option for version 2.1 or
later. Suffix for include files changed to .h; BOOL changed to Boolean
(BOOL doesn't work in g++ v 2.0); modifications to allow for compilers
that destroy temporaries very quickly; (Gnu users - see the section of
compiler performance). Added CleanUp, LinearEquationSolver, primitive
version of exceptions.

<P>
<B>Newmat05 - June 1992:</B>
<P>
For private release only 
<P>

<B>Newmat04 - December 1991:</B>
<P>
Fix problem with G++1.40, some extra documentation

<P>
<B>Newmat03 - November 1991:</B>
<P>
Col and Cols become Column and Columns. Added Sort, SVD, Jacobi,
Eigenvalues, FFT, real conversion of 1x1 matrix, <I>Numerical Recipes in
C</I> interface, output operations, various scalar functions. Improved
return from functions. Reorganised setting options in "include.hxx".
<P>

<B>Newmat02 - July 1991:</B>
<P>
Version with matrix row/column operations and numerous additional
functions.
<P>

<B>Matrix - October 1990:</B>
<P>
Early version of package.
