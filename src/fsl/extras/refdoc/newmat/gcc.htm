<B>Gnu G++ 2.6.0, 2.7.2, 2.8.1:</B>  These work OK.
<P>
If you are using 2.7 or later remember to edit include.h to deactivate my Boolean
class - not necessary if you are using my <A HREF="make.htm">make</A> file. But
if you are using a version earlier than 2.7 edit the second line of gnu.mak to
<TT>CXXFLAGS = -O2 -Wall</TT>
<P>
For versions earlier than 2.6.0
you must enable the options TEMPS_DESTROYED_QUICKLY and
TEMPS_DESTROYED_QUICKLY_R.
You can't use expressions
like <TT>Matrix(X*Y)</TT> in the middle of an expression and
<TT>(Matrix)(X*Y)</TT> is
unreliable. If you write a function returning a matrix, you MUST use the
<A HREF="memory.htm">ReturnMatrix</A> method described in this documentation.
This is because g++
destroys temporaries occurring in an expression too soon for the two
stage way of evaluating expressions that newmat uses. You will have
problems with versions of Gnu
earlier than 2.3.1.
<P>
Gnu seems to
leave some rubbish on the stack. Possibly this is a buffer or
dynamically loaded subprogram so may not be a bug.
<P>
<B>Linux:</B> It works
fine on my copy of G++ 2.7.2. In 2.6.?, <TT>fabs(*X++)</TT> causes a
problem. You may need to write you own non-inlined version.
