Do you
<OL>
<LI>understand <TT>*</TT> to mean matrix multiply and not element by element
multiply

<LI>need matrix operators such as <TT>*</TT> and <TT>+</TT> defined as operators
so you can write things like
<PRE>
    X  = A * (B + C);
</PRE>
<LI>need a variety of types of matrices (but not sparse);

<LI>need only one element type (float or double);

<LI>work with matrices in the range 10 x 10 up to what can be stored in
memory;

<LI>tolerate a large package.
</OL>
<P>
Then maybe this is the right package for you.
