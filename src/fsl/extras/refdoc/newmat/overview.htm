I use .h as the suffix of definition files and .cpp as the suffix of
C++ source files.
<P>
You will need to compile all the *.cpp files listed as program files in the
<A HREF="files.htm">files section</A>
to get the complete package.
Ideally you should store the
resulting object files as a library.
The tmt*.cpp files are
used for <A HREF="testing.htm">testing</A>,
example.cpp is an <A HREF="example.htm">example</A> and sl_ex.cpp,
nl_ex.cpp and garch.cpp are examples of the
<A HREF="nonlin.htm">non-linear</A> solve and
optimisation routines. A demonstration of the exception mechanism is
in test_exc.cpp.
<P>
I include a number of <I>make</I> files for compiling the example and the test
package. See the section on <A HREF="make.htm">make files</A> for details.
But with the PC compilers, its pretty quick
just to load all the files in the interactive environments by pointing
and clicking.
<P>
Use the large or win32 console model when you are using a PC. Do not <I>outline</I>
inline functions. You may need to increase the stack size.
<P>
Your source files that access the newmat will need to #include one or
more of the following files.
<DL>
<DT>include.h:
<DD>if you want to access just the compiler options

<DT>newmat.h:
<DD>to access just the main matrix library (includes include.h)

<DT>newmatap.h:
<DD>to access the advanced matrix routines such as Cholesky
decomposition, QR triangularisation etc (includes newmat.h)

<DT>newmatio.h:
<DD>to access the output routines (includes newmat.h)
You can use this only with compilers that support the standard input/output
routines including
manipulators.

<DT>newmatnl.h:
<DD>to access the non-linear optimisation routines (includes newmat.h)

</DL>
<P> 
See the section on <A HREF="custom.htm">customising</A>
to see how to edit include.h for
your environment and the section on <A HREF="compiler.htm">compilers</A>
for any special problems with the compiler you are using.
