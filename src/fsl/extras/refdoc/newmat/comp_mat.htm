<P>The package does not yet support matrices with complex
elements. There are at least two approaches to including these.
One is to have matrices with complex elements.

<P>This probably means making new versions of the basic row and
column operations for Real*Complex, Complex*Complex, Complex*Real
and similarly for + and -. This would be OK, except that if I
also want to do this for sparse matrices, then when you put
these together, the whole thing will get out of hand.

<P>The alternative is to represent a Complex matrix by a pair of
Real matrices. One probably needs another level of decoding
expressions but I think it might still be simpler than the first
approach. But there is going to be a problem with accessing elements
and it does not seem possible to solve this in an entirely
satisfactory way.

<P>Complex matrices are used extensively by electrical engineers
and physicists
and really should be fully supported in a comprehensive package.

<P>You can simulate most complex operations by representing
<TT>Z = X + iY</TT> by
<PRE>
    /  X   Y \
    \ -Y   X / 
</PRE>
Most matrix operations will simulate the corresponding complex
operation, when applied to this matrix. But, of course, this matrix
is twice as big as you would need with a genuine complex matrix library.
