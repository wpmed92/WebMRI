<P>
This is the <I>how to use</I> documentation for newmat plus the background information on its design.
<P>
This document is available as an ascii file, newmat.txt, and in hypertext
format for reading with an HTML browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer.
Cross-references in the ascii version are given as section numbers. The
HTML version can be downloaded from the same
<A HREF="where.htm">site</A> as the source files. There is also a version in RTF format.
<P>
There is additional support material on my <A HREF="where.htm">web site</A>.
<P>
In the hypertext version of the documentation
four cross-references are given at the top of each
page for navigating. Think of a printed version of the manual arranged in
sections, sub-sections and sub-sub-sections. <I>Next</I> takes you through the
manual in the order of the printed version; keep clicking <I>Next</I> until you
get back to this page if you want to see the whole manual. <I>Skip</I> goes to
the next section, sub-section or sub-sub-section at the same level in the
hierarchy as the section, sub-section or sub-sub-section that you are
currently reading. <I>Up</I> takes you up one level in the hierachy and
<I>start</I> gets you back here.
<P>
<B>Be sure to read the section on <A HREF="custom.htm">customising</A>
before attempting to compile newmat.</B>
