<B>Watcom C++ (version 10):</B> this works fine. Don't try to run
Watcom's exceptions and my simulated exceptions at the same time.
<P>
But best don't use Watcom's exceptions at all in this version as they do
seem to cause problems; even when not used.
<P>
It seems fine on Optima++ 1.0 in console mode. I haven't tested it
in gui mode.
Optima++ provides some stuff to insert in the main program.
