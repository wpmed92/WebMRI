<P>The <I>newmat</I> library is for the manipulation of matrices,
including the standard operations such as multiplication as
understood by numerical analysts, engineers and mathematicians.

<P>A matrix is a two dimensional array of numbers.
However, very special operations such as matrix multiplication
are defined specifically for matrices. This means that a
<I>matrix</I> library, as I understand the term, is different
from a general <I>array</I> library.
<P>
I see a matrix package as providing the following

<BR>1. Evaluation of matrix expressions in a form familiar to
scientists and engineers. For example <TT>A = B * (C + D.t());</TT>.
In particular <TT>*</TT> means matrix multiply.

<BR>2. Access to the elements of a matrix;

<BR>3. Access to submatrices;

<BR>4. Common elementary matrix functions such as determinant and
trace;

<BR>5. A platform for developing advanced matrix functions such as
eigen-value analysis;

<BR>6. Good efficiency and storage management;

<BR>7. Graceful exit from errors.

<BR>It may also provide

<BR>8. A variety of types of elements (eg real and complex);

<BR>9. A variety of types of matrices (eg rectangular and
symmetric).

<P>In contrast an array package should provide

<BR>1'. Arrays can be copied with a single instruction; may have
some arithmetic operations for elementwise combination of arrays,
say <TT>+</TT>, <TT>-</TT>, <TT>*</TT>, <TT>/</TT>, it may provide matrix
multiplication as a function;

<BR>2'. High speed access to elements directly and perhaps with iterators;

<BR>3'. Access to subarrays and rows (and columns?);

<BR>6'. Good efficiency and storage management;

<BR>7'. Graceful exit from errors;

<BR>8'. A wide variety of types of elements (eg int, float, double, string etc);

<BR>9'. One, two and three dimensional arrays, at least, with
starting points of the indices set by user.

<P>It may be possible to amalgamate these two sets of
requirements to some extent. However <I>newmat</I> is definitely
oriented towards the first set.
