<H3>FreeSurfer - Cortical flattening and modelling</H3>

<a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/freesurfer/index.html" target="_top">FreeSurfer</a> is a
set of tools for reconstruction/flattening of the brain's cortical
surface and subcortical segmentation/registration, produced at MGH,
Boston. It can, for example, be used to overlay functional data onto
the inflated/flattened cortical surface, or carry out multi-subject
FMRI statistics on the cortical surface. We have worked together with
MGH to make interoperation of FSL and FreeSurfer as easy as possible.

<!-- <a href="../afni/index.html" target="_top">AFNI</a> is a package for -->
<!-- processing, analyzing, and displaying FMRI data. One of AFNI's -->
<!-- particular strengths is that it is a powerful display tool. Recent -->
<!-- changes to AFNI make it very easy to view FSL output, in particular, -->
<!-- FEAT output. -->
