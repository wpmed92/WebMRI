<H2>Customising FSL</H2>

FSL can be customised for different output datatypes and other features.
There are several environment variables which FSL uses to determine
certain user preferences, such as the output file format (NIFTI,
Analyze, etc). The defaults for these are set when you source the
setup file as shown above (i.e., ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh or
${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh). If you wish to change these defaults
then you need to:<pre>
cd
mkdir .fslconf
cd .fslconf</pre>

and in this directory create a file called fsl.sh or fsl.csh,
depending on the shell that you use, setting any or all of the
variables that appear in the central ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh or
${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh files. 
<p>
<b>
DO NOT copy the central files into <kbd>~/.fslconf/</kbd> as it
will cause a loop that will stop your login from working.
</b>
<p>
It is recommended that the files <kbd>~/.fslconf/fsl.sh</kbd> or
<kbd>~/.fslconf/fsl.csh</kbd> only include a few variable definitions
and nothing more.  Note that whoever installs FSL can also edit the
central files in <kbd>$FSLDIR/etc/fslconf</kbd> to change the
preferences for all users.
